This is the second generation simulator for my i960Zx series processor

It is meant to be installed into an Adafruit Grand Central M4 and expose tons
of cool features to the emulated i960 environment. 

It will be a very very very simple design. The i960 instruction set is frankly my favorite.
I do not actually have access to much software because the i960 was a failure outside 90s 
embedded platforms.

I will have to spin up my own software with the ultimate goal being to try and run doom. Although, I'm not
sure how easy that will be to do. But I'm getting ahead of myself
